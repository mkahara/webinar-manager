# Webinar Manager
A WordPress plugin to manage webinars on a website.

## Description
This plugin provides a Gutenberg based user-friendly page to create and edit webinars using blocks.


## Features
The plugin consists of three blocks;

- Webinar block - This is the main block, it provides a form in the editor which allows the content manager to enter the Title, Subtitle, Start date, End Date, Duration and Description. There are also two custom metaboxes to select the webinar category and also the speakers for the webinar.
- Webinar highlight - This block allows the content manager to add highlights to the webinar, the highlights can be as many as he/she wants. It allows them to enter the highlight time and title.
- Webinar promotion - This block allows the content manager to insert a short webinar promotional block that makes the regular readers aware of the upcoming webinar. It is easy to use as the content manager only needs to select a webinar from a list of the existing webinars.
